# Real-Time Object Detection in Next.js using TensorFlow.js

🚀 This project implements **real-time object detection** using **Next.js** and **TensorFlow.js**, leveraging the **COCO-SSD model** for detecting objects through a webcam.

## 📌 Features
- 🔍 **Real-Time Object Detection** using COCO-SSD
- 🎥 **Webcam Support** for live object recognition
- ⚡ **Runs Fully in Browser** (No backend required)
- 🖥️ **Built with Next.js & TensorFlow.js**

## 🛠 Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Project
```sh
npm run dev
```
Then open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

## 🎯 How It Works
1. The model loads when the page is opened (**takes a few seconds**).
2. It accesses the webcam and detects objects in real time.
3. Detected objects are displayed dynamically on the screen.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Next.js** – Frontend framework
- **TensorFlow.js** – Machine learning in the browser
- **COCO-SSD** – Pre-trained object detection model

## 📝 To-Do / Future Improvements
- Improve detection accuracy
- Add support for other models
- Enhance UI/UX
